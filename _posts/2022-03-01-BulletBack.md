I created a 2D zombie survival game using the Python library Pygame. The game, called BulletBack, features a player character who must escape
from zombies and survive for as long as possible. The player can move in two directions, and shoot zombies with a gun. The game includes
multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and a high score system that allows players to compete for the highest score.

used python, pygame
