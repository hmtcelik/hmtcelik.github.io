I created a web application using Python Django, to allow university students to rate and review their professors. Features a user registration and login system, a search functionality to find and rate professors, and a review system that allows users to leave
comments and ratings on professorâ€™s teaching quality, communication, and other factors.

used python, django, html-css-js, postgresql, unicorn, ngnix
